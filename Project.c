/*This will be a colour-detecting robot: It will follow a line based on its colour pattern.
 For example, if a center line is blue, there will be a green line on the right and
 a red line on the left so that the robot can stay on track. It will display the colour
 it is seeing on the screen, and when it reaches a black box at the end of the line it
 will dance and "sing".*/
